# ðŸŒ¾ Stress Detection System for Sugar-Beet Fields

This repository contains the codebase for an unsupervised stress detection pipeline designed for identification of stress conditions in sugar-beet crops using temporal satellite imagery and autoencoder-based feature extraction.

## ðŸš€ Overview

The system integrates temporal feature extraction and clustering to identify stressed regions in sugar-beet fields over a growing season. Key components include:

- 3D Autoencoder for unsupervised feature learning  
- Sinusoidal positional encodings to represent acquisition dates  
- K-Means clustering for discovering patterns in latent space  
- Sub-patch-level analysis and field-level results
